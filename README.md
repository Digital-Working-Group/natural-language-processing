# Natural Language Processing
This repository contains example workflows, READMEs, sample data, and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) files that facilitate the usage of various open-source voice feature extraction packages, tools, datasets, and models for natural language processing.

It is a part of a larger [toolkit](https://github.com/FHS-BAP/Voice-Feature-Extraction-Toolkit/) that was developed to support scientific research surrounding investigations of relationships between brain aging and voice features, although the extraction of voice features does have wider applicability. We invite others to please offer their questions, ideas, feedback, and improvements on this repository.

| **spacy** | spaCy is an open-source Python library for Natural Language Processing. For example, spaCy supports the conversion of text into Doc objects, which come with various useful attributes. These attributes include parts-of-speech tagging, tokenization, and dependency parsing. These attributes can be used to extract linguistic features of interest from text. |
