You know, when I think back on my life, it’s funny how the little things really shape who you become. I grew up in this small town called Ridgewood, tucked away in the countryside. It wasn’t much—just rolling hills, a couple of farms, and one main street with a diner where everyone knew your name. My parents were both teachers, so education was always this big part of my life from the get-go. They instilled in me the importance of learning but also the value of kindness and community.

School was… interesting. I went to Ridgewood Elementary and then the local high school. Being small towns go, everyone knew each other, and I had this tight-knit group of friends that felt more like family. I was never the star athlete or the class president, but I loved reading and writing. English class was my safe haven. My teachers always encouraged me, and I think that’s when I started to realize that I wanted to do something with words—maybe journalism or something creative.

After high school, I headed off to state university. That was a big change—moving from a place where everyone knew me to a bustling campus with thousands of students. It was exciting but also overwhelming at first. College pushed me in ways I didn’t expect. I joined the campus newspaper, started as a reporter covering tiny events like club meetings, then worked my way up to editor by senior year. Those years were some of the best and hardest of my life. I learned how to manage deadlines, handle criticism, and tell stories that mattered.

When I graduated, I wasn’t totally sure what I wanted to do next, but I had this writer’s itch I couldn’t ignore. I took a job at a small local paper back home, covering community news and human interest stories. It was grounding and reminded me why I loved writing—because it could connect people in ways nothing else could. After a couple years, I moved to a bigger city to work for a regional magazine, diving into longer, more investigative pieces. That’s where I really found my voice and discovered that journalism could be more than just facts—it could be a way to affect change.

Life wasn’t all work, though. Along the way, I met some incredible people, traveled to places I’d never imagined, and faced challenges that tested my resilience. I got married to my college sweetheart, who’s been my partner through every twist and turn. Together, we bought a small house with a garden in a quiet neighborhood—they say it’s the suburbs, but to me, it feels like home.

Now, I’m working as a freelance writer and editor. It’s a juggling act—finding clients, pitching stories, and trying to carve out time for my own projects—but I wouldn’t trade it for anything. I’ve started writing a book, a sort of memoir about growing up in Ridgewood and the people who shaped me. It’s slow going, but every chapter feels like a little trip back to that diner on Main Street, sipping coffee and watching the world go by.

Looking back, I realize life is this mosaic of moments—some big, some tiny, but all pieces of the bigger picture. I’m grateful for where I started, the education I got, and the journey that brought me here. There’s still a lot ahead, I’m sure, but for now, I’m content telling my story and seeing where it takes me next.
