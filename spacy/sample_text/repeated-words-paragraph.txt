Growing up on a lake, lake days were the best days. Every morning morning, the sun would rise slowly over the water, casting golden light over the dock where my friends and I would jump jump in, splash splash, and laugh without end. The sound of waves waves gently lapping against the shore was our lullaby, and every evening evening, fireflies would dance like tiny stars, lighting our night nights with magic and memories.
