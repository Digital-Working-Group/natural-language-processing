| Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency                                       | Function: `tf_idf()` in `term_freq_inverse_doc_freq.py`. This function takes in a natural language processor, filepath, document list and target string(term). It first calculates term frequency, which is defined as the frequency of a target string in a document. Then, it calculates inverse-document-frequency, which is defined as log10 of the number of documents divided by the number of documents containing the term. TF-IDF is calculated by multiplying these two values. | TF-IDF is a method used to evaluate importance of a word to a document in relation to a larger collection of documents. It combines term frequency (how often a word appears in a document) with inverse document frequency (total number of documents / number of documents containing term t).
